This just has one small code to get the Bitcoin market confidence data from the crypto fear and greed index. It took me 10 minutes to write. 

##
Ways to grow this code
* Add the large bitcoin holders purchase information from coinbase 
* Add Information for a large market fluctuation

* Make this into an android app to notify the user when there is a buy/sell opportunity. It might be a good way to get some experience with app development.
